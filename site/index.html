Welcome to the website for cvsps.  This is the official ugliest website in the world.

<h3>about</h3>
cvsps is a command line utility for Linux 
and other UNIX type operating systems.  While cvs is a fantastic and widely
used revision control system, it leaves some gaps.  cvsps attempts to fill 
one of those gaps.  To quote the <a href="README">README</a>:

<pre>
cvsps is a program for generating 'patchset' information from a CVS
repository.  A patchset in this case is defined as a set of changes made
to a collection of files, and all committed at the same time (using a
single 'cvs commit' command).  This information is valuable to seeing the
big picture of the evolution of a cvs project.  While cvs tracks revision
information, it is often difficult to see what changes were committed
'atomically' to the repository.
