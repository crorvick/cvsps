## Test for the daughter-branch bug from the old git-cvsimport manual page.

# This was the description:
#
# * This applies to files added to the source branch *after* a daughter
#   branch was created: if previously no commit was made on the daughter
#   branch they will erroneously be added to the daughter branch in git.

         "This is a superflous file, a sanity check for branch creation.\n")
