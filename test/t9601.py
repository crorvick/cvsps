## Test handling of vendor branches
#
# This test was swiped from the git 1.8.1 tree, then modified to exercise
# cvsps directly rather than through git-cvsimport.
#
# Description of the files in the repository:
#
#    imported-once.txt:
#
#       Imported once.  1.1 and 1.1.1.1 should be identical.
#
#    imported-twice.txt:
#
#       Imported twice.  HEAD should reflect the contents of the
#       second import (i.e., have the same contents as 1.1.1.2).
#
#    imported-modified.txt:
#
#       Imported, then modified on HEAD.  HEAD should reflect the
#       modification.
#
#    imported-modified-imported.txt:
#
#       Imported, then modified on HEAD, then imported again.
#
#    added-imported.txt,v:
#
#       Added with 'cvs add' to create 1.1, then imported with
#       completely different contents to create 1.1.1.1, therefore the
#       vendor branch was never the default branch.
#
#    imported-anonymously.txt:
#
#       Like imported-twice.txt, but with a vendor branch whose branch
#       tag has been removed.
