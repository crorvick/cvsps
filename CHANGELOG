1.3
- fix case where CVSROOT is initial substring of Repository when
  creating strip_path variable.

  Thanks to Jean-Michel Rouet <jean-michel.rouet@philips.com> for
  this fix.

- fix case where a subdirectory has a different CVSROOT or Repository
  path from the toplevel directory (happens when one project is checked
  out inside another projects subdirectory).

  Thanks to Philippe M. Chiasson <gozer@cpan.org> for the fix.


1.2

- Moved cache file location to CVS/ subdirectory.  This is where CVS keeps
  it's meta-data, and putting the cache there keeps it out of the way of
  other CVS operations. (thanks to Amitai Schlair for suggestion)

- Added manual page.  (thanks to Amitai Schlair for suggestion)

- Fixed the '-b' option to take a special branch name 'TRUNK' which
  will restrict the output to patchsets made on the main trunk.
